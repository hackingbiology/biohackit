**Q1** · Should OAuth social login (GitHub, Google) be live from day one, or stubbed and enabled later?  
Default taken: **stubbed** — OAuth provider secrets would need to be in CI and dev env from day one; enabling live OAuth in M13 Hardening is cleaner. Reverse if you want OAuth active earlier.

**Q2** · Email-only accounts (no visible username), or email + chosen display name used as the public handle?  
Default taken: **email-primary auth, display name as public handle** — `User.email` is the auth credential, `Profile.display_name` is the public-facing slug. Reverse if you want a separate username field.

**Q3** · Docker Compose for local development, or should the README document bare-metal PostgreSQL + local Python instead?  
Default taken: **Docker Compose** — reproducible for contributors; devs who prefer bare-metal can ignore it. Reverse if you want Docker optional-only.

**Q4** · `Measurement` hypertable: set up the TimescaleDB hypertable in M00 migrations now (empty), or defer until M02 Blood Layer when data first arrives?  
Default taken: **set up in M00** — avoids a painful later migration that may need to convert an existing table; the hypertable is empty until M02. Reverse if you prefer to defer.
